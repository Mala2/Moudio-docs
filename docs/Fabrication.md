# Fabrication


## PCBs

If you're interested in building your own MouDio Speaker using this design, the PCBs for the project can be ordered from a manufacturer such as PCBWay or JLCPCB. These companies can produce the PCBs according to the specifications provided, and they offer various options for the type and quantity of PCBs you need. Once the PCBs are manufactured, you can assemble the components onto the PCBs to complete the speaker. Detailed instructions for assembly can be found on the project's website or in the accompanying documentation. Just make sure the PCB Thickness is 1.60mm.

## Grills

The speaker design includes front and back grills made from acrylic using laser cutting. The grills add a polished, finished look to the speaker, and they also protect the components inside from dust and debris. The laser-cut acrylic is a durable and high-quality material that allows sound to pass through while providing a sleek, modern appearance. The grills are easily attached to the speaker using the provided screws and can be easily removed for cleaning or maintenance.

If you're interested in purchasing the front and back grills. They can be ordered from a company that specializes in laser cutting acrylic. Many local sign shops or fabrication companies offer laser cutting services, and you can provide them with the design specifications for the grills. Alternatively, you can order the grills online from a company that offers laser cutting and acrylic fabrication services, such as Ponoko (which I used) or Inventables or Acrylic Craft. The grills can be custom-made to fit your desire, and they can be shipped directly to you for easy installation
