# Fabrication


## PCBs

If you're interested in building your own MouDio Speaker using this design, the PCBs for the project can be ordered from a manufacturer such as PCBWay or JLCPCB. These companies can produce the PCBs according to the specifications provided, and they offer various options for the type and quantity of PCBs you need. Once the PCBs are manufactured, you can assemble the components onto the PCBs to complete the speaker. Detailed instructions for assembly can be found on the project's website or in the accompanying documentation. Just make sure the PCB Thickness is 1.60mm.

JLCPCB's custom 3D printing service is a great option for those who want to produce high-quality prints with precise dimensions and accurate details. By using advanced 3D printing technologies, such as Stereolithography (SLA) or Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), JLCPCB can produce custom 3D printed parts with high resolution and precision. This means that you can create complex and detailed parts, such as speaker enclosures, that are tailored to your specific needs and requirements.

Additionally, JLCPCB's custom 3D printing service can help to avoid the offsets and dimensional inaccuracies that can sometimes occur with conventional 3D printing methods. By using advanced 3D printing technologies and high-quality materials, JLCPCB can produce custom parts with consistent dimensions and accurate details. This can help to ensure that your custom parts fit together properly and function as intended, without the need for additional adjustments or modifications.

Overall, JLCPCB's custom 3D printing service is a great option for those who want to produce high-quality, accurately detailed parts for their projects.

I recommend Stereolithography (SLA) which is a type of 3D printing technology that uses a laser to cure liquid resin into solid parts. SLA is known for producing high-resolution and highly detailed prints, making it a popular choice for applications that require precision and accuracy. Because of its high resolution and accuracy, SLA is often used to produce complex and intricate parts, such as speaker enclosures.

To order a custom 3D printed enclosure from JLCPCB, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the JLCPCB website and create an account.

2. Once you have an account, you can upload your enclosure design files to the   website. JLCPCB accepts a wide range of file formats for 3D printing, including STL, OBJ, and SLDPRT.

3. After uploading your design files, you can select the type of 3D printing technology that you want to use, such as Stereolithography (SLA) or Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). You can also specify the material that you want to use for your enclosure, such as resin or plastic.

4. Once you have selected all of the options for your enclosure, you can add the item to your cart and proceed to checkout.

5. At checkout, you can review your order and enter your payment information. JLCPCB accepts a variety of payment methods, including credit card and PayPal.

6. After placing your order, JLCPCB will begin processing and manufacturing your enclosure. You can track the status of your order through your account on the JLCPCB website.

## Grills

The speaker design includes front and back grills made from acrylic using laser cutting. The grills add a polished, finished look to the speaker, and they also protect the components inside from dust and debris. The laser-cut acrylic is a durable and high-quality material that allows sound to pass through while providing a sleek, modern appearance. The grills are easily attached to the speaker using the provided screws and can be easily removed for cleaning or maintenance.

If you're interested in purchasing the front and back grills. They can be ordered from a company that specializes in laser cutting acrylic. Many local sign shops or fabrication companies offer laser cutting services, and you can provide them with the design specifications for the grills. Alternatively, you can order the grills online from a company that offers laser cutting and acrylic fabrication services, such as Ponoko (which I used) or Inventables or Acrylic Craft. The grills can be custom-made to fit your desire, and they can be shipped directly to you for easy installation

### Specifications

|       	| DIMENSIONS            	| NOTE                 	|
|-------	|-----------------------	|----------------------	|
| FRONT 	| 272.5  x 74  x 3 mm   	| It can be 1.5 - 3mm 	|
| BACK  	| 272.5  x 74  x 1.5 mm 	| It must be 1.5mm     	|

### Example from Ponoko

1. [Download FRONT Grill #1](https://github.com/Mala2/Moudio/blob/main/3D-Files/Grill/1/Front%20Pattern%201_logo.ai)

* Only the front grill needs to be in .ai format in order to get the Logo engraved.

2. Upload your files at https://www.ponoko.com/designs. Wait...

3. Set design size Width = 272.5, Height = 74mm

4. Select laser process for Cutting and Line Engraving. And hit confirm. 

5. Select you favorite material (Make sure thickness range of 1.5-3mm)
